Loving life is easy when you are abroad. 
Where no one knows you and you hold your life in your hands all alone, you are more master of yourself than at any other time. 
In the opacity of foreign places all specific references to yourself are blurred. 
It is easy to conquer unhappiness when the general knowledge that you are unhappy is not there to disgrace you, when your unhappiness is not reflected by innumerable mirrors, focused upon you so that it strikes you again and again.
It is easy, as long as you are young, to surrender to the pure force of life, which always advises submergence and forgetfulness. 
It is easy to forget yourself when the reason for all your unhappiness, your “infamous birth,” is not recognized, not observed, not counted.
